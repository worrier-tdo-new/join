I want you to generate a complete website project.  
Website name: { "Your Website Name" }  
Website description: { "Your Website Description" }  

🔹 Requirements:  
1. Use a clean and reusable **folder structure**:  
   PROJECT_NAME/  
   ├── assets/  
   │   ├── css/ (all stylesheets)  
   │   ├── js/ (all scripts)  
   │   ├── img/ (images, icons, logo, favicon)  
   │   └── fonts/ (optional, custom fonts)  
   ├── pages/ (about, services, contact, faq, etc.)  
   ├── posts/ (if blog/articles are needed)  
   ├── index.html (homepage)  
   ├── privacy.html  
   ├── terms.html  
   ├── sitemap.html  
   ├── robots.txt  
   └── README.md  

2. Each HTML file should include:  
   - Proper `<head>` (meta title, description, favicon, responsive tag).  
   - A **nav bar placeholder** (you won’t add full nav by default, just a placeholder section).  
   - Footer with copyright + year.  
   - Minimal semantic structure (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).  

3. Make sure to:  
   - Keep the design responsive (mobile-first).  
   - Link CSS/JS from the `assets` folder.  
   - Use generic text/content that can be replaced later.  

🔹 Important Instructions:  
- When I ask for a specific file (e.g., *“give me index.html”*), you will generate **only that file’s code**.  
- When I say *“add navbar”* or *“add section”*, you will update/extend the requested file’s code accordingly.  
- Keep code clean, commented, and ready to expand.
